# Why?

In two years I wanna have a definitive history of Go concepts I have taught myself with well commented code explaining how I understand what it does.

## Aren't you already developing a 1000+ line(s) game in Go?

While trying not to come across as a shameless plug, game development, especially in Ebitengine can and has grown in complexity but in a way that requires clever solutions to meet the demands of adding new mechanics and not in a way that utilizes everything that Go has to offer.
